FT2GUI Version 1.0.2
====================

This is a little program I wrote some time ago:

A configuration applet for the OS/2 TrueType DLL.

Note: This is not related with the Innotek font engine.

The TrueType support in OS/2 can be driven either by

- IBM's TRUETYPE.DLL
- FREETYPE.DLL originally done by Michal Necacek, 
               now maintained by Ko Myung Hung

Both DLL's should be located in x:\OS2\DLL (where x: is your boot drive).

FT2GUI.EXE can do the following things for you:

- Switch between TRUETYPE.DLL and FREETYPE.DLL (you still have to reboot,
  this is a limitation of OS/2).
- Configure some options provided by FREETYPE.DLL.

That's all.
